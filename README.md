# ZSAT

This is a port of the SAT solver from z3 into Rust. It is an exercise primarily to learn about the higher-level software
engineering strategies that emerge in larger code bases that are different in Rust than in C++ and other languages. I
chose the z3 SAT solver to learn how z3 is architected and how industrial strength SAT solvers work.

Developing a working SAT solver and creating a useful library are _not_ goals of this project. Nontheless, if you want
to write a high-powered SAT solver in Rust or want to understand how z3 works but you don't speak C++, this code might
be useful to you. Or not. Who knows?
